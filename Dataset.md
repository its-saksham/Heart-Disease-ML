#  Heart Disease Prediction Dataset â€“ Summary  

This dataset is based on the **2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)** survey. After cleaning and removing missing values, it includes around **400,000 U.S. adults** across all 50 states.

Our aim:  
ðŸ‘‰ Predict heart attack risk using personal health dataâ€”no invasive tests required.

Yes/No indicators for:  
`HadDiabetes`, `HadStroke`, `HadCOPD`, `HadAsthma`, `HadKidneyDisease`,  
`HadArthritis`, `HadDepressiveDisorder`, `HadAngina`, `HadSkinCancer`  

---

##  Preventive Care  
- `FluVaxLast12`, `TetanusLast10Tdap`, `PneumoVaxEver`  
- `HIVTesting`, `ChestScan`, `COVIDPos`, `LastCheckupTime`  

---

##  Disabilities  
Yes/No indicators for:  
`DifficultyWalking`, `DifficultyErrands`, `DifficultyConcentrating`,  
`DifficultyDressingBathing`, `DeafOrHardOfHearing`, `BlindOrVisionDifficulty`  

---

##  Oral Health  
- `RemovedTeeth`: Count of teeth removed due to decay or gum disease  

---

##  Prediction Target  
- **`HadHeartAttack`**:  
  - *Yes*: ~6% of people  
  - *No*: ~94% of people  

> **Note:** The dataset is imbalanced. Successful modeling requires oversampling techniques (e.g., SMOTE) or class-weight adjustments to avoid biases toward the majority class.

##  TL;DR  
A rich dataset capturing **health, habits, and demographics** of 400k Americans in 2022â€”perfect for building reliable, real-world heart attack risk models using **Logistic Regression** (or any classifier).
